WebChat is a team project aimed at building a simplified instant messaging platform similar to Slack or Telegram. The application consists of a chat server and multiple chat clients (users), allowing users to send and receive messages in real-time over the Internet. Essential functionalities include authentication, creating and managing chat rooms, chatting, displaying message history, and proper database management for storing user information and messaging history.

The project follows a modular and scalable architecture, adhering to best practices and design patterns. The frontend is built using React.js, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. The backend utilizes Node.js and Express.js for handling server-side logic and API routes. MongoDB is used as the database to store user information, chats, and messaging history.

The project follows a test-driven development approach, with unit tests covering backend functionality and integration tests for API routes and database interactions. The test plan includes detailed test cases for unit testing, feature testing, and system testing to ensure robustness and security.
